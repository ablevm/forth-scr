scr

A tool for working with Forth code blocks.

scr converts 1024-byte Forth code blocks to (and from) a plain-text source code
format modeled on the 16x64 screen format and designed for reading and writing
using common software.

A screen contains 16 lines of code and each line of code can contain at most 64
characters followed by a newline character.

Screens may optionally include line numbers and screen numbers.

Spaces should be used for indenting code.
