A tool for working with Forth screen files.

scr converts standard 16x64 Forth screens to (and from) a "mostly plain text"
source code format which can be displayed or modified using common *nix tools.

A line of code can contain at most 64 characters and is followed by a newline.

Spaces should be used for indenting code.
